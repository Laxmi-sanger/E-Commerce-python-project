In this project, I explored various aspects of a retail dataset to derive valuable business insights and decision-support metrics.
Hereâ€™s what I covered:

Monthly sales trend: Identified best & worst months.

Sales analysis across product categories & sub-categories.

Monthly profit breakdown to understand business performance.

Category-wise and segment-wise profit drivers.

Sales-to-profit ratio analysis for efficiency assessment.
